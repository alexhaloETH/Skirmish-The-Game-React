when a new instance of the game is started and the wallet was previously connected, the react code connects to the argent wallet
but not the unity game

silentconnect() finishes before the game is even ready, possible solution is call a function at game init from unity it self
-----  ISSUE ABOVE FIXED THE FUNCTINO JUST DOES NOT CALL AT THE RIGHT TIME FOR SOME REASON ----


issue on start of new instance straight after load there seems to be a call to CheckBalanceERC20 but ofcourse the wallet isnt connecte


need ot divide the current balance by the const tokenOffset
